;  Unit Settings Reference
;
;HitPoints - starting hitpoints of unit
;TrashCost - trash required to build unit
;GasCost - gas requried to build unit; N/A for Mutants
;PeopleCost - people required to build unit; N/A for Humans
;BuildTime - time to construct unit; 100 = one sec
;TopSpeed - speed at which unit moves
;Acceleration - how quickly unit reaches speed
;RoadFactor - time factor on roads - lower is faster; only applies for vehicle units
;Radius - how large unit is; large units are easier to hit for inaccurate weapons
;Radius_Moving - same as Radius, but applies when unit is moving
;AttackDamage - amount of damage per attack -- not necessarily damage per second
;AttackDamage_Moving - damage used when moving
;AttackRange - range of unit; Can be Melee, Short, Medium, Long, VeryLong, or it can be custom
;AttackMinRange - optional; default is 0.9 to prevent units from trying to attack a target on the same spot
;AttackArea - area of effect; use 0.0 for weapons without AOE
;AutoMinimizeArea - default is 0.2; -1 means off; area-of-effect of weapon is automatically reduced (down to specified amount) to avoid friendly-fire; only applies to friendly-fire weapons
;FriendlyFire - default is on; if off weapon cannot harm friendlies
;RunAndGun - default is on; if off then weapon cannot get Run-And-Gun
;HitAir - default is on; if off, weapon cannot hit air unless unit is in the air ; if Never, then unit can never hit air.  if NeedRange, then RangeToAttackAir is considered.
;MustDescendToHitGround - default is off.  If on, unit cannot hit the ground while levitating.
;CanUseGrenades -- default is off.  If on, unit can use all grenade types (EMP, sticky bomb, etc).
;TurretRotation - optional; how quickly weapon rotates; only applies to units with turrets
;RateOfFireStart - delay before first attack; used to make attack animations look better; with Target Tracking this is forced to zero for launcher-type weapons; 100 = one sec
;RateOfFireContinue - delay before all attacks after first; 100 = one sec
;RateOfFireStart_Moving - same as RateOfFireStart, but it applies when unit is moving
;RateOfFireContinue_Moving - same as RateOfFireContinue, but it applies when unit is moving
;AccuracyGround - Applies when attacking ground targets. See http://forums.inhumangames.com/viewtopic.php?t=7214
;AccuracyAir - Applies when attacking air targets (flying, levitating, etc). See http://forums.inhumangames.com/viewtopic.php?t=7214
;AccuracyCurveSpacingForX - default value is 0.1.  See http://forums.inhumangames.com/viewtopic.php?t=7214
;AccuracyBonusFactorForAltitude - default value is 0.5.  How much of an accuracy bonus (or penalty) does this weapon get for being on higher ground?  Higher is better.
;AccuracyBonusCloseRange - default value is 0.3.  How much of an accuracy bonus does this weapon get for being in close range?  Lower is better.
;AccuracyBonusCloseRange_AirGroundMismatch - default value is 0.8.  Applies with attacking from air-to-ground or ground-to-air. Lower is better.
;PopLimitScore - optional, overrides default setting.  1.0 = one gatling car.  AI uses this to assess value of units, so be careful with it.  Override default for free units or units with special hidden costs (like PK unit)
;TechUsageScore - optional; how many upgrades unit uses per level; overrides default value, which is the pop-limit score.
